# Explanation for problem 2
The data structure used was a list to keep track of indices and maintain
the data structure of the input. The algorithm then uses a binary search
step to divide the input list into the two ordered sub lists. Then the
algorithm used the provided linear search function to get the index of interest.
The time complexity is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).
