# Explanation for problem 1
The data structured used for this problem is an integer that keeps track
of the index to determine the floored square root value. The algorithm is
designed to use the least amount of time and space possible by calculating
the squared value of the index step wise until it meets or passes the value of 
the number given to the function.

The time complexity is O(log(n)) and the space complexity is O(1).
