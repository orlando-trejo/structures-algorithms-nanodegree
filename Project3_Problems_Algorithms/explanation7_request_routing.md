# Explanation for problem 7
The Trie and dictionary structures were used as defined by the problem. The Trie
Tree algorithm was implemented to make use of the dictionary structures. The
Trie Tree works by defining and using a RouteTrieNode with handler and children
attributes and an insert method. The RouteTrie is then constructed with a handler
attribute and insert and find methods. This follows the basic Trie construction
from the class notebooks and problem 5.

The time and space complexity is O(n).
