# Explanation for problem 3
Used list to keep track of indices. I used the quick sort algorithm to sort
the numbers in descending order. The algorithm is based on a recursion method
that compares the pivot value on the left side of the list of numbers with
the values on the right side of the list, and works its way in to sort the
numbers in the list in a descending order. The algorithm form the Quick Sort
Walkthrough Notebook.

Time complexity is O(nlog(n)) with space complexity O(n).
