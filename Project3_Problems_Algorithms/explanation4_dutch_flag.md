# Explanation for problem 4
Used lists to keep track of indices. The algorithm used to sort the numbers
consists of a while loop that moves 0s to the left side of the list, 2s to the
right side of the list, and keeps the 1s in place. This allows to not use extra
space and run through the algorithm in O(n).

Time and space complexity is O(n).
